# Functions

Declaring functions are quite simple, by using the `fn` keyword, the name of the function, parenthesis including the parameters, an arrow, and your codeblock.

```
fn my_function() -> {
    // ...
}
```

Anonymous functions just require the parenthesis with params, an arrow, and your codeblock.

```
() -> {}
```
